Aurora is a local-first desktop music player built for people who want full control over their library, playback flow, and data.
Version **1.3** expands Aurora into a broader media hub with podcasts, advanced sync workflows, and smarter library tooling while keeping the app fast and private.

## Functional Areas in Detail

### Library

The library is built around deterministic local indexing. You define source directories, Aurora scans and updates tracks, and the UI reflects changes quickly.
For compilation-heavy collections, grouping options and improved sync behavior help keep metadata tidy and browsing consistent.

**Benefits**
- Reliable local indexing for large collections
- Better handling of mixed-artist albums
- Fast updates after imports and metadata edits

### Podcasts

Aurora 1.3 introduces podcast support as a first-class area. You can discover shows, subscribe, refresh episodes from RSS feeds, and sync selected episodes to your target device.
Podcast content is managed with the same local-first mindset as music.

**Benefits**
- One app for music and podcasts
- Simple discovery and subscription flow
- Seamless sync to external listening devices

### CD Import

The CD import workflow focuses on fast FLAC archiving with clean folder and file naming.
You can configure output directory, naming template keywords, and Discogs credentials for richer metadata.

**Benefits**
- Cleaner digital archive from physical media
- Consistent naming standards across imports
- Less manual post-processing after ripping

### Album View vs Artist View

**Album View** is release-centric. It emphasizes a single album’s identity, tracks, genres, and album-level actions.
This is best when you want focused playback, edit album metadata, or work through an album as a complete work.

**Artist View** is catalog-centric. It emphasizes the artist as the entry point and groups related releases for exploration.
This is best for browsing an artist’s wider discography and moving between albums quickly.

**Practical difference**
- Use Album View for depth and per-release control
- Use Artist View for breadth and discovery across releases

## Privacy

Aurora is privacy-first:

- No telemetry
- No analytics
- No user behavior tracking
- Local database and local media ownership

Some metadata enrichment flows may perform explicit online lookups when that feature is used, but Aurora does not send analytics or profiling data.
